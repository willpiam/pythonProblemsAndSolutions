python 3 projects writen for grade 12 programming
Feel free to use my code only if you are sure you understand
what each line does. Never implement code you don't understand. Rewrite each line
when you use these ideas in your own code to ensure you are learning to code
(not just learning to fake it).

Not all the ideas here are original to me. But all the ideas here are UNDERSTOOD
by me. I just want people to learn to program... not just copy/past.

happy pythoning
