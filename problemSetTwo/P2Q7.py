    if there are 10 animals in a lab and enough food for 1000 animals, and
    every hour the number of animalsâ€™ doubles and enough food for
    another 4000 animals is added, determine when the population exceeds its
    food supply
"""

# my approch
# calculate the number of animals every hour
# calculate the number of food every hour (unit will be the AFU standing for animal feeding unit)
# then ill check to see if there is to many animals for the food
# if is enough food ill do the next hour

import math

anml = 10#start num of animals
food = 1000#start amount of food
count = 0#start at zero because adding one is the first thing we do

#equation is anml = 10*(math.pow(2,count))
#and food = 1000 + (4000*count)

while (anml <= food):#this is where the actaul work is done
    count = count +1
    food = 1000 + (4000*count)
    anml = 10*(math.pow(2,count))

print ("num of animals: " + str(anml))#outputing
print ("can feed: " +str(food))
print ("hours passed: " +str(count))
